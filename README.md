# 16 bit computer 
 written in python by a computer obsessed gcse student and is not gonna go well but here goes

so yeah I decided to make a computer in python cos i got bored of imagining life using a computer from the last 10 years,
i figured that the solution was just to make my own in python

im using python because it is the only language i am familiar with however if performance becomes an issue for a basic command line
operating system that i intend to make, which i suspect it will be it may be a smart idea to use c++ as i have some very basic knowledge
about it so i wouldnt need to start learning completely from scratch




my idea for the computer is that each memory register will be a python object that is defined / created on the initialisation of the program 
so a binary value (a list of integers [0-1]) can be stored in the variable and controlled by an object class
    (i could also use tuple when i assign values to memory so that i am not tempted to change individual bits but idk)

 all operations / arithmetic operations that this program will perform will be in binary and the entire system will run on a basic
    set of binary functions (for example, AND, NOT, OR, ADD, SUB, DIV) and so on, all of these functions will manipulate the values
    just like on real hardware
it would probably easier to do other arithmetic operations and things to do this however this could be implemented into a minecraft redstone computer
my friend may implement this for me if the architecture is feasable to implement as he is an expert on restone computers

my long term goal (if i actually work on this project and not forget about it) is the following:

    - create a hardware system that can run binary commands (probably an 8 bit instruction set) and store 16 bit numbers using a 16 bit memory addressing system
    - create a basic command line that can run on the virtual hardware
    - implement an custom low level language (assembly) that can be written in a code editor and compiled for use on the vm
    - implement a system for applications and running programs / saving them in storage
    - make this into a full application (im not gonna try doing a pyinstaller exe though as im using linux as my development platform so it would be impractical)
