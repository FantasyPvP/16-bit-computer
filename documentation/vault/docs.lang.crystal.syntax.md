the crystal language has a fairly easy to learn syntax similar to python. 

for example it uses colons and indentations for things like loops, if statements and functions in teh same way that python does.

one key difference between python and this language is that in this lanugage you must declare the type of the variable, so integer string etc...
for example:

INT x = 100

STR y = "this is a string"

BOOL z = False

these are the three native data types in the language.
